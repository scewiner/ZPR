首先 你的 timer 1 是 模式 0 （ 13 位 计数器 ） ， 除非 <你>_S 用 很 低 频率 的 外部 晶体 ， 否则 timer 1 的 定时 时间 根本 就 不是 秒级 。	First of all , your Timer 1 is a mode 0 ( 13-bit counter ) , and unless you use a very low frequency external crystal , Timer 1 's timing time is not at all a second .

其次 你 没有 贴出 time run 标志 被 修改 的 位置 。 如果 你 怀疑 timer1 没有 持续 工作 ， <你>_S 可以 暂时 去掉 if ( time run = = 1 ) 条件 ，	If you suspect that Timer1 is not working continuously , you can temporarily remove the if ( time run = = 1 ) condition .

观察 数码管 是否 每次 都 显示 变化 的 值 。 顺便 说 一句 你的 timer0 中断 里面 的 语句 效率 低下 ， 这 不是 一个 健康 的 中断 服务 函数 。	Observe whether the digital tube shows a change in value every time .

Second , I 've tried to remove Time Run , but the problem is the same .
第三点 ， 我试 过 将 timer0 的 内容 移到 另 一个 函数 去 ， 然后 <我>_S 在 timer0 里 加上 一个 a = 1 ，	Third , I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function and then add a = 1 to Timer0 ,	Third , I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function , and then you added a = 1 to Timer0 ,	Third , I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function and then add a = 1 to Timer0 ,	Third , I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function and then add a = 1 to Timer0 ,	Third , I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function and then add a = 1 to Timer0 ,
主 函数 里 加上 if ( a = = 1 ) { 这里 运行 刚才 所说 的 函数 } ，	If ( a = = 1 ) { \ displaystyle ( a = = 1 ) { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = = 1 ) } } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = 1 ) } { } } } ,	If ( a = = 1 ) { \ displaystyle ( a = = 1 ) { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = = 1 ) } } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = 1 ) } { } } } ,	If ( a = = 1 ) { \ displaystyle ( a = = 1 ) { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = = 1 ) } } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = 1 ) } { } } } ,	If ( a = = 1 ) { \ displaystyle ( a = = 1 ) { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = = 1 ) } } { \ frac { 1 } { if ( a = 1 ) } { \ frac { 1 } { } { if ( a = 1 ) } { } } } ,	Add if ( a = = 1 ) { Run the function you just described here } to the main function ,
函数 的 第一行 写 了 a = 0 ， <它>_S 试图 给 中断 服务程序 减肥 的 ， 但 程序 动 不了 了 。 红外 遥控 的 部分 ， 因为 时间 关系 摘 的 资料 ， 所以 <我>_S 也 不是 很会 。	The first line of the function says a = 0 .
