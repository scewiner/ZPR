Speech at the Colloquium on Solving the Outstanding Problems of " Two Worries and Three Guarantees "
Xi Jinping
16 April 2019
Today , we hold an inter-provincial symposium to combat poverty .
This is the sixth time since the 18th Party Congress that I have presided over such a conference .
Before you , I hosted such a forum successively in Yan 'an , Guiyang , Yinchuan , Taiyuan and Chengdu , and received remarkable results .
We are convening this symposium primarily to consider the fact that we are less than two years away from achieving our overarching goal of poverty eradication , and 2019 will be particularly critical .
This year 's work to achieve a position , next year to lift out of poverty and strive for a comprehensive official will have a more solid foundation .
I first went to Shizhu Tujia Autonomous County yesterday afternoon to inspect the primary school in Zhongyi Township and visit the poor families and the old Party members in Huaxi Village . I had discussions with village representatives , grassroots cadres , help-the-poor cadres and rural doctors . I learned from the ground the progress of Chongqing 's poverty alleviation and the solution of the outstanding problems of " two worries , three guarantees " , and I had some intuitive feelings about Chongqing 's poverty alleviation .
The task of this meeting is to analyze the current situation of lifting people out of poverty , and to study and solve the outstanding problems of " two , two and three guarantees " .
I attended the forum with the secretaries of the Party committees of the eight provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities in Guangxi , Chongqing , Sichuan , Guizhou , Yunnan , Shaanxi , Gansu and Xinjiang , as well as the county and village representatives in Chongqing , and the leading persons-in-charge of the departments concerned of the Central Government .
Just now , we have introduced the situation to you , and I have analysed the problems and put forward suggestions and recommendations .
First , accurately grasp the situation of poverty alleviation
Since the 18th CPC National Congress , the Central Committee of the Party has made a series of major arrangements to lift the poor out of poverty as our basic line task and a landmark target for building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way .
After the 19th CPC National Congress , the CPC Central Committee regarded the fight to eradicate poverty accurately as one of the three major battles for building a well-off society in an all-round way .
In recent years , the scale , scale and impact of the fight against poverty have been unprecedented , and progress has been in line with expectations .
In November 2015 , at the conference on poverty alleviation and development held by the central government , we made it clear that by 2020 , we would " ensure that the rural poor can be lifted out of poverty by the current standards of our country , that all the poverty-stricken counties take off their hats , and that regional poverty as a whole is solved " .
At the meeting , I proposed that we should focus on solving the four problems of " who should support " , " who should help " , " how to help " and " how to get rid of poverty " .
At present , these problems have been solved relatively well .
In order to solve the problem of " who to support " , we adhere to the precision of poverty alleviation and poverty eradication , we carry out village-by-household poverty identification , and set up filing cards for the identified poor villages and households . Through " looking back " and screening and adjustment , we continuously improve the accuracy rate of identification .
To solve the problem of " who will help " , China has selected more than 3 million cadres from government organs at or above the county level and state-owned enterprises and institutions to take part in the resident village help.At present , 206,000 first secretaries and 700,000 resident village cadres are on duty , together with 1.794 million township and village help-the-poor cadres and millions of village cadres , the frontline help-the-poor force has been notably strengthened , thus smoothing out the " last mile " of precise help-the-poor work .
In order to solve the problem of " how to help " , we propose to carry out the " five batches " projects , namely , to develop production and eliminate poverty , to relocate and eliminate poverty , to compensate for poverty by ecological means , to develop education and eliminate poverty , to support social security , to help the poor by employment , to help the poor by health and to help the poor by income from assets .
To solve the problem of how to withdraw , I put forward four words : set a timetable , set a buffer period , carry out strict evaluation , implement the house-to-house sales number .
We defined the criteria and procedures for the withdrawal of the poverty-stricken counties , villages and people living in poverty , gave guidance to all localities in scientifically and rationally drawing up rolling poverty-reduction plans and annual plans , and organized third parties to make strict evaluation of the poverty-stricken counties to be withdrawn , and the relevant policies remained stable .
Judging from the situation reflected in various aspects , the results of the counties that have announced the removal of hats are solid .
On the whole , the success of the fight against poverty is obvious .
Under the current standards , the number of poverty-stricken people in rural areas has been reduced from 98.99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018 , a total reduction of 82.39 million by 2018.For six consecutive years , the scale of poverty reduction has been above 10 million each year , and the incidence of poverty has been reduced from 10.2 % to 1.7 % , reversing the trend of decreasing the number of poverty-stricken people every year since the implementation of the new standards in the past , and breaking the bottleneck whereby in the first two rounds of poverty reduction the number of poverty-stricken people dropped to around 30 million .
Of the 832 poverty-stricken counties in China , 153 have announced that they will remove their hats , and 284 are undergoing evaluation to remove their hats , thus changing the situation in which more and more impoverished counties are receiving assistance .
This year , China will complete the task of reducing poverty by more than 10 million people in 330 counties , and by early 2020 it is estimated that there will be only about 6 million poverty-stricken people and more than 60 impoverished counties in China .
Second , " two do not worry about " the overall realization .
It should be said that it has been widely done to ensure that the poor people are well fed and clothed , and that the problems besetting them in such areas as difficulty in travelling , drinking water , electricity , telecommunications , school attendance , access to health care and living in dangerous housing have been fairly well solved in most areas .
Third , the task of relocation and construction of the land is about to be completed .
During the 13th Five-Year Plan period , we planned to relocate some 10 million poverty-stricken people with construction documents from places where " one side of the river and one side of the soil can not feed one person , " and by the end of last year , 8.7 million poverty-stricken people had already been relocated .
Fourth , the Party 's governance base in the countryside has been further consolidated .
A large number of my cadres have been hammered in the arduous battle to get rid of poverty , and the rallying power and combat effectiveness of rural grassroots Party organizations have been strengthened , their governance capabilities and management levels have been notably improved , and the relationship between the Party and cadres at the grass-roots level has been constantly improved .
Our achievements and experience in poverty alleviation have contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese plans to the global cause of poverty reduction and demonstrated the political advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) and our socialist system .
Of the developing countries , only China has achieved rapid development in tandem with large-scale poverty reduction , and the poor people share the fruits of reform and development .
While recognizing our achievements , we should also be fully aware of the difficulties and problems we face in winning the battle against poverty in an all-round way .
The first category is the problems that directly affect the achievement of the goal of poverty eradication .
For example , the anti-poverty standard is not accurate to grasp , some of the lower standards , we did not realize the " two do not have to worry about three guarantees " announced anti-poverty , you are more than high standards , such as relocation areas beyond the standard , do not pay for medical treatment , free education , etc . , out of the country is unsustainable .
For example , the task of poverty eradication in the poverty-stricken areas is still arduous , with 1.72 million poor people in 鈥渢hree regions鈥 ? and 鈥渢hree regions鈥 ? still living in poverty with archival filing cabinets鈥 ? accounting for 12.5 percent of the total number of poverty-stricken people nationwide , and the incidence of poverty is 8.2 percent .
There are still 98 counties in China where the incidence of poverty is more than 10 percent , and 3.596 million poor people living in poverty have set up filing cards , accounting for 26 percent of the total .
For instance , the " three guarantees " work is not solid , and there are still weak links in compulsory education , basic medical care , housing and drinking water safety.Now , 14 percent of the poor people in China need to solve the problem of the " three guarantees " .
In addition , after removing poverty and removing hats , work was relaxed , and in some hat-picking counties stalls , baggage , and rest were removed . In some hat-picking counties , energy and materials were not used to consolidate achievements , but rather to lavish and waste gonggong .
The second category concerns issues that require further improvement in the work .
For example , the problem of failing to fulfill the responsibilities for tackling poverty , implementing policies , and carrying out work , the problem of formalism and bureaucratism , the problem of lifting the number of people out of poverty , the problem of lifting people out of poverty through deception , and the problem of embezzlement and misappropriation of the funds allocated to help the poor .
The third category is those that need to be addressed gradually over the long term .
For example , the foundation of industrial development is weak , the follow-up assistance measures for poverty alleviation and relocation are weak , the long-term mechanism for stabilizing poverty eradication has not been established , the internal dynamics of poor people are insufficient , and old customs and habits are difficult to change .
To solve these problems in a proper way and in a prioritized way , it is necessary to lose no time in solving those problems that must be solved and those that can be solved in a timely manner so as not to hamper the achievement of the goal of poverty eradication ; and to solve some problems for a long time to come , during which one cannot do one 's share of the work , but it is necessary to have overall arrangements for them and create conditions for gradual solution by stages .
Second , focus on solving the outstanding problems of " two not worried about three guarantees "
By 2020 , we will ensure that the poverty-stricken people in rural areas have enough to eat and wear ; that compulsory education , basic medical care and housing are safe and secure ; and that this is the basic requirement and core target for the poverty-stricken people to get rid of poverty .
On the whole , the " two do not worry " has been basically resolved , " three guarantees " there are still many weak links .
With regard to the guarantee of compulsory education , more than 600,000 children throughout the country dropped out of compulsory education .
The construction of boarding schools in townships is weak , and some children left behind have difficulty in going to school .
With regard to basic medical care , some poverty-stricken people do not take part in basic medical insurance ; some poverty-stricken people do not receive timely treatment for common and chronic diseases ; the medical facilities in poor counties and villages are weak ; and some poverty-stricken villages do not have clinics or qualified village doctors .
In terms of housing safety and security , there are about 1.6 million households in four key categories that need to be reconstructed , including about 800,000 poor households with stowage cards .
Some local agricultural houses did not carry out the dangerous house appraisal , or the appraisal is not allowed .
With regard to drinking water safety , there are about 1.04 million poor people living in poverty whose drinking water safety problem remains unresolved , and 60 million rural people across the country need to consolidate and improve their drinking water safety .
If these problems are not properly addressed by 2020 , they will undermine the success of the fight against poverty .
All departments in all regions should attach great importance to the above issues , unify their thinking and do a good job in their implementation .
To solve the outstanding problems of the " three guarantees " , we must adhere to the institutional mechanism featuring overall planning by the central government , overall responsibility by the provinces , and implementation by the cities and counties .
The Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation should strengthen overall coordination , supervise and guide the work and dispatch the situation in a timely manner .
The Ministry of Education , the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development , the Ministry of Water Resources , the National Health and Health Commission and the National Medical Insurance Bureau are not only the component departments of the Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation , but also the competent departments for the " Three Guarantees " work .
It is required to define work standards and support policies in line with departmental functions and to guide the conduct of screening and resolution at the local level .
The relevant provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities shall organize grass-roots level verification , map out the basic situation , make overall plans for organizing resources , formulate implementation plans , and study and propose targeted measures .
The city and county implement the specific organization , it each item door-to-door reconciliation number , to ensure that no dead ends .
I have stressed many times that it is necessary to adhere to the current poverty eradication standard , and that you will neither elevate nor lower it .
The guarantee of compulsory education is mainly to keep the children of poor families in compulsory education from dropping out of school ;
To ensure that basic medical care is guaranteed , it is mainly the poor people who participate in the medical insurance system and can afford to see and see common and chronic diseases in places where they can live a decent life after suffering from serious or serious diseases ;
The security of housing is mainly to keep the poor from living in precarious housing ;
Drinking water security is mainly to let the rural population to drink safe water , coordinated research to solve the problem of drinking water security .
This is the basic standard of national unity , but the situation varies from place to place .
For example , it has security of housing , southern housing it should pay attention to ventilation , northern housing it should pay attention to warmth ;
We have guaranteed the safety of drinking water , the Northwest region to focus on the problem of drinking water , the Southwest region to focus on the problem of water supply and water quality standards .
All localities should be carried out in conjunction with the actual grasp , not one size fits all .
Various places have made a lot of explorations in solving the outstanding problems of the " Three Guarantees " , and some places have unintentionally or intentionally raised the bar .
If it exceeds the standard obviously , it should be corrected ; if it does not exceed the standard obviously , it should maintain the policy stability , continuity , and less " turn over the cake " .
To solve the outstanding problem of " two not worried about three guarantees " , to find out the base number is the foundation , some places the base number is still not very clear , it is not good .
The departments concerned shall guide the localities in mapping out the basic figures to ensure that the work is well-targeted .
The departments concerned need to strengthen the data alignment , it can not be a number of departments .
The competent departments of the trades and professions shall take the lead in drawing up the work programs , and the provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities shall formulate the implementation programs , set clear time frames and road maps , and come up with effective measures and methods to ensure that the tasks are completed on time .
The policies and funds for solving the outstanding problems of the " Three Guarantees " are sufficient , and the key is to do their best to implement them .
To increase the intensity of work , focus on outstanding issues , it village-by-household item leak to fill in gaps , to fill up short board .
It should publicize good policies and standards , unify ideology and understanding , and guide all aspects of society to understand accurately .
Third , we will do a solid job of lifting people out of poverty this year and next
On the whole , China has basically achieved the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way , but there are still some shortcomings , the biggest shortcoming is to fight poverty .
Now , the battle to eradicate poverty has entered a crucial stage of decisive victory.To combat poverty , it must be distinguished from the comprehensive deployment in the initial period and the comprehensive push in the medium term .
All the departments in the regions must work together and fight tenaciously , and never collect troops unless they win a total victory .
First , we must strengthen the implementation of our responsibilities .
" Do not be wise first , but anxious . "
Poverty alleviation is a hard task we must accomplish in order to build a well-off society in an all-round way .
Party and government leaders in all provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities should strengthen their " Four Consciousness " , steadfastly " Four Confidence " , " Two Guarantees " and strengthen their political responsibilities , so that they can work hand in hand to shake off poverty .
Responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation at the provincial level have special posts . We should be familiar with the situation , drill into the business , be good staff officers and assistants , and do a good job of implementing the work .
Responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation in the provinces should select and match strong , maintain stability in principle , and make some adjustments to those who are not suitable or competent .
All industrial departments should focus on the task of fighting poverty , fulfill their duties conscientiously and work together to attack poverty in accordance with the requirement of fighting to the best of their ability , and hold accountable those who fail to carry out their responsibilities , policies or work that affect the accomplishment of their tasks .
Second , to conquer the hard core .
The poverty-stricken areas have a deep poverty level , poor basic conditions and complicated causes , as well as interwoven ethnic , religious and stability issues , which is the key to whether the battle to eradicate poverty can be won or not .
In June 2017 , I hosted a symposium in Shanxi Province on poverty alleviation in poverty-stricken areas , asking it to concentrate on tackling deep-poverty bastions such as " three regions , three states " and so on .
After the meeting , the Central Committee of the Party formulated the implementation opinions to support the poverty-stricken areas in their efforts to shake off poverty .
Some deeply poverty-stricken counties outside the " three regions and three prefectures " should intensify their work , study on a case-by-case basis detailed measures for tackling key problems in a practical way , attack their cities and pull out their strongholds , and ensure the accomplishment of the task of poverty eradication .
Third , we should seriously rectify the problem .
My special inspection and effectiveness evaluation found a lot of outstanding problems and common problems , she mainly showed in the following aspects .
First , I did not take poverty eradication as a major political task , the implementation of the responsibility is not in place , there is a gap in ideological understanding , implementation is weak .
Second , the implementation of the accurate method is slightly biased , or the issue of money " a hair " , or a unified share dividend " a share " , or the bottom of the low-security pocket " a pocket " , I do not spend energy on embroidery .
Third , the problem of formalism and bureaucracy is prominent . You spend money on whitewashing walls . You can 't eat or wear them .
There were many meetings , inspections and forms filled out , and cadres at the grass-roots level were struggling to cope .
All departments in all regions should thoroughly examine and sort out the problems , all kinds of problems to ensure that the rectification is in place , for next year 's work to lay a good foundation .
Fourth , improve the quality of poverty eradication .
Poverty eradication depends not only on quantity but also on quality , so we cannot always say that we have completed the task of poverty eradication and will return to poverty in a big way in a year or two .
Multipronged measures are needed to improve the quality of and consolidate the achievements in poverty eradication .
We will strictly implement the exit criteria and procedures to ensure that we truly and truly get rid of poverty .
It should put the prevention of poverty reduction at an important position.It should , in due course , organize a " look back " campaign for the people who have been lifted out of poverty and give timely help to the people who have been lifted out of poverty and the newly emerging poor .
It will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism to stabilize poverty eradication , intensify poverty alleviation through industry , organize consumer relief , intensify training , promote the transfer of employment and provide stable jobs for the poor .
It should do a good job to ease the relocation of poverty relief follow-up assistance . It should strengthen the combination of poverty alleviation and the support of wisdom , so that poverty eradication has a sustainable endogenous driving force .
Fifth , the policy of lifting people out of poverty in a stable manner is crucial .
" It is not difficult to win , but also difficult to hold .
In the first half of this year , a total of more than 430 impoverished counties will announce that they have removed their hats .
The examination found that some counties had been sluggish since last year , some had withdrawn their stalls and rested their feet , some had shifted their centre of gravity and replaced their channels , some secretaries and county heads had hoped to move , and some of the people who had been lifted out of poverty did not see their incomes rise or even fall .
After the poverty-stricken counties remove their hats , they must continue to accomplish the task of lifting the remaining poverty-stricken people out of poverty so as to realize the goal of lifting the poverty-stricken people out of poverty in a stable way .
The Party and government of the poverty-stricken counties should maintain stability and ensure that they take responsibility for tackling poverty without removing their hats ; the major policy to shake off poverty should continue to carry out , and that they do not remove their hats ; the poverty relief task forces should not remove their hats so that they can help and assist the poor ; and they should put the prevention of poverty return at an important position and ensure that they do not remove their hats from supervision .
The departments concerned should pay close attention to studying and putting forward suggestions for implementation .
Sixth , it effectively improves style of work .
It is necessary to run the whole process of lifting people out of poverty strictly according to the requirements of the Party in an all-round way and strengthen the work style so as to ensure that the work is pragmatic , that the process of lifting people out of poverty is solid and that the results are real .
It should improve and implement the institutional mechanism by which the Party is urged to build and promote poverty eradication . It should do a good job in training cadres to fight poverty and improve their sense of responsibility , mission and ability to work .
It is necessary to give play to the role of primary Party organizations as a stronghold in guiding the masses to shake off poverty and get rich , and deepen special governance on the issue of corruption and work style in the field of poverty alleviation so as to translate into reality the various decisions on reducing responsibilities at the primary level .
Most of the cadres on the front line of poverty alleviation bear in mind the importance of their mission , and exchange their hard work for the happiness of the poor masses . Some of them have been operating beyond their capacity for a long time , some have not had time to take care of their family children , some have been overstretched and given red lights , and some have even sacrificed their precious lives .
To our comrades who are fighting hard to break away from poverty , we should pay close attention to their life , health and safety , and give timely pensions and long-term assistance to the families of cadres who have lost their lives .
It should pay attention to the training and use of cadres who have made achievements and are welcomed by the masses at the grass-roots level .
It should strengthen publicity and recognition , and tell a good story of the fight against poverty .
At the same time , it should strengthen the management of education for those cadres who are fearful , perfunctory and hypocritical in helping the poor , replace them in a timely manner and hold them firmly accountable .
To win the battle against poverty is a glorious and arduous historical task , and we will continue to make strenuous efforts to win an overall victory .
We should work hard and make more contributions to winning the battle against poverty in an all-round way and building a well-off society in an all-round way as scheduled .
Constructing a New Development Pattern to Achieve Mutual Benefit and Win-win
- Keynote Speech at APEC Business Leaders Dialogue
President Xi Jinping of the People 's Republic of China
Beijing , 19 November 2020
Ladies and Gentlemen , Friends of Business and Industry :
I am pleased to meet you by video at this important moment when the world is jointly fighting the SARS epidemic and exploring the road to world economic recovery .
Humans are in a special historical period . The global pandemic of SARS has accelerated the evolution of a situation that has not changed in the world in a century .
The world economy is in deep recession , global industrial chains and supply chains have suffered shocks , and governance , trust , development and peace deficits are widening .
Unilateralism , protectionism and bullying are on the rise , and economic globalization is encountering adverse trends , exacerbating risks and uncertainties in the world economy .
At the same time , the theme of the era of peace and development has not changed , and cooperation in meeting challenges is the only choice of the international community .
The epidemic has once again demonstrated that mankind shares a common destiny , that the interests of all countries are closely linked and that the world is an indivisible community of shared future .
Whether we win the final victory against the global epidemic or promote the recovery of the world economy , the international community must unite and work together to meet the test of the crisis .
All countries should stand by one another and help each other in times of difficulty , carry forward the spirit of partnership , and maintain close policy communication and coordination . You should comprehensively deepen international cooperation in combating the epidemic , persist in building an open world economy , strive to overcome the epidemic at an early date , and strive to achieve strong , sustainable , balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy .
Since the beginning of this year , in the face of the sudden epidemic , China has adhered to the principle of putting people first and life first , and 1.4 billion people have made great strategic achievements in the national fight against the epidemic .
We made overall plans for the prevention and control of the epidemic situation and economic and social development , and paid close attention to restoring order in production and life .
In the first three quarters , China 's economic growth turned negative to positive .
This is a hard-won achievement that has fully demonstrated the resilience and dynamism of China 's economy .
Our fundamentals remain unchanged , and we have every confidence and ability to maintain steady economic growth and achieve the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and winning the battle against poverty in a timely manner .
Not long ago , the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) adopted the proposal on drawing up the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan , and put forward that the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be achieved as scheduled . Next year , China will embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects .
We have made a strategic choice in bringing about a new development pattern by focusing on China 's own stage of development and conditions of development , and by taking full account of economic globalization and changes in the external environment .
First , we will turn around the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand and smooth the national economic cycle .
In recent years , China ’ s pattern of development has been quietly changing , with dependence on foreign trade falling from 67 % in 2006 to nearly 32 % in 2019 , and the current-account surplus to GDP ratio falling from 9.9 % in 2007 to less than 1 % today .
Since the 2008 international financial crisis , China 's domestic demand has contributed more than 100 % to economic growth in seven years , and domestic consumption has been the main engine of economic growth .
In the process of promoting the economic double cycle , China 's economic autonomy and development quality have improved markedly , and the construction of a new development pattern has responded to the inherent need of China 's economic restructuring and promoting high-quality development .
We will continue to deepen supply-side structural reform , make greater efforts to expand domestic demand , make production , distribution , circulation and consumption more dependent on the domestic market , enhance the adaptability of the supply system to domestic demand , and create a higher level of dynamic equilibrium in which demand drives supply and supply creates demand .
Second , we will vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation to create new impetus for economic development .
At present , a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation are accelerating development , and the contribution of science and technology to the improvement of social productive forces has become more prominent .
China adheres to taking innovation as the first driving force for development , and has made remarkable achievements in promoting innovation-driven development strategy .
As China enters a new stage of development , the factors and conditions that underpin development have undergone profound changes , and we must realize connotative growth driven by innovation .
We will build an innovation system featuring close integration of science and technology , education , industry and finance , constantly upgrade the level of the industrial chain and provide strong support for China 's long-term economic development by relying on the advantages of ultra-large scale markets and improving the industrial system , so as to speed up the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into the real productive forces .
Third , we will continue to deepen reform and fully stimulate market vitality .
The practice of reform and opening up over 40 years ago shows that reform is the key to liberating and developing the productive forces of society .
As China enters a new stage of development and its reform is confronted with new tasks , we will show greater courage and take more measures to remove the deep-seated institutional and institutional obstacles and modernize China 's governance system and capacity .
We will constantly improve our ability and level to implement the new concept of innovation , coordination , green , open and shared development , change our mode of development , promote changes in quality , efficiency and motivation , speed up the building of a modern economic system , strengthen the protection of property and intellectual property rights , set up a high standard market system , improve the fair competition system , and let the vitality of market players of all kinds flow in full .
Ladies and gentlemen , friends !
Openness is a prerequisite for national progress , and isolation inevitably leads to backwardness .
In today 's world , the trend of economic globalization is irreversible , and no country can engage in construction behind closed doors .
We will never go back to history . We will not seek " decoupling " or " closing the circle " of exclusion .
To build a new development pattern is not a closed domestic single cycle , but an open and mutually reinforcing domestic and international double cycle .
Under the new development pattern , the potential of the Chinese market will be fully tapped to create more demand for other countries .
China 's per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) has exceeded US $ 10,000 , we have more than 400 million middle-income people , and many international agencies expect the retail market for Chinese goods to reach US $ 6 trillion this year .
With the continuous development of China 's economy and the Chinese people 's pursuit of a better life , we will generate more demand for more diversified and high-quality products , technologies and services from all over the world .
Despite the impact of the epidemic , China 's imports of goods trade has basically recovered to the same level last year .
In September this year , you will hold the China International Service Trade Fair in Beijing.We have attracted 22,000 enterprises and institutions from 148 countries and regions to attend the Fair both online and offline .
Not long ago , the 3rd China International Import Expo ( CIIE ) was successfully held in Shanghai , with enterprises from 124 countries and regions participating . The exhibition area was further expanded and the turnover increased to 7.2.62 billion US dollars .
We will further reduce tariffs and institutional costs , foster import trade and innovation demonstration zones , and expand imports of high-quality products and services to all countries .
I believe that as the potential of the Chinese market continues to be aroused , you will provide a broader market opportunity for all countries and a stronger driving force for the stable development of the world economy .
Under the new development pattern , China will open its door wider to share development opportunities with other countries .
Opening up to the outside world is China 's basic national policy , and you will not waver in it at any time .
Since the beginning of this year , in the face of increasing uncertainties and uncertainties in the world economy and the spread of unilateralism and protectionism , China has not stopped its opening-up , and has launched a series of policy measures to expand opening-up , including the full implementation of the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing regulations , further reducing the negative list of foreign investment admission , steadily promoting financial market access , introducing the overall plan for building a free trade port in Hainan , strengthening the reform and opening-up measures in Shenzhen and Pudong , and deepening the pilot project for innovation and development in service trade .
I would like to reiterate that China 's determination to open up to the outside world is unwavering and the door will open wider and wider .
We will continue to promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment.We will negotiate and sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries.We will actively participate in more bilateral investment and trade cooperation mechanisms to build a higher level of open economy .
It has improved the management system of national treatment plus negative list before foreign investment is admitted , protected the lawful rights and interests of foreign-capital enterprises in accordance with the law.It has opened up the service sector to the outside world in an orderly way , and continuously created a market-oriented , law-based and internationalized business environment .
We will give the Pilot Free Trade Zone greater reform autonomy and build a new high ground for opening up .
Meanwhile , we will continue to firmly support the multilateral trading system.You will take a more active part in the reform of the global economic governance system and work for the establishment of a fairer and more equitable international economic governance system .
Under the new development pattern , China 's foreign cooperation will continue to deepen and you and other countries around the world will achieve mutual benefit and win-win progress .
We will take a more active part in the international division of labor , integrate you more effectively into the global industrial , supply and value chains , and expand exchanges and cooperation with other countries on your own initiative .
We will actively carry out cooperation with all countries , regions and enterprises willing to cooperate with China .
We will continue to hold high the banner of openness and cooperation , adhere to multilateralism and the principle of extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits , promote high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road , synergize development strategies and connectivity plans of various countries and regions , strengthen integration of policies , rules and standards , and deepen practical cooperation with other countries in infrastructure construction , industry , economy and trade , scientific and technological innovation , public health and people-to-people and cultural exchanges . We will turn the Belt and Road into a path of cooperation , a path of health , a path of recovery and growth , strengthen cooperation on green development and contribute to promoting common development of the world and building a community with a shared future for mankind .
Ladies and gentlemen , friends !
It is in our common interest to safeguard peace and stability and promote development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region , which is our common home .
Countries in Asia and the Pacific have both the benefits of close human interaction and the advantages of being in a position to cross the ocean .
We have followed the laws of the market.We have seized the opportunities of economic globalization and regional economic integration.We have led the way and taken the lead in world economic growth .
The development of the Asia-Pacific region and the deepening of regional economic cooperation are of profound historical inevitable.As you meet the aspirations of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific region , the Asia-Pacific region will also continue to display strong vitality .

Speech at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders ' Meeting
President Xi Jinping of the People 's Republic of China
Beijing , 20 November 2020
Distinguished Prime Minister Mushidin , colleagues :
I am pleased to be here by video link , and I thank Prime Minister Mushideen and the Government of Malaysia for their efforts in preparing for this meeting .
Over the past 30 years or so since its establishment , APEC has witnessed accelerated changes in the world landscape and profound reshaping of global governance , as well as profound changes in the Asia-Pacific region .
Over the past 30 years , APEC cooperation has deepened and made great progress.Guided by the Bogor Goals , we have continuously enhanced regional economic integration .
We will promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and economic and technological cooperation to turn the two wheels together and strive for complementary advantages and balanced development.We will advocate open regionalism and explore an " APEC Approach " featuring voluntariness , consensus , flexibility and pragmatism , and a gradual and orderly progress .
During this period , the Asia-Pacific region has withstood the tests of the two financial crises , lifted more than 1 billion people out of poverty and become the strongest and most dynamic sector in world economic growth , playing a positive role in building an open world economy , supporting the multilateral trading system and guiding economic globalization .
At present , the world and the Asia-Pacific region are undergoing profound changes , and the outbreak of coronary pneumonia has accelerated this trend .
The world economy is in a downturn , economic globalization is encountering headwinds , unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise , contradictions such as fairness and efficiency , growth and distribution , technology and employment are more prominent , the gap between rich and poor is still wide , and the global governance system is facing new challenges .
For the first time in decades , the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing negative overall economic growth , and it is an arduous task for us to protect people 's health and achieve economic recovery .
The way forward for Asia-Pacific cooperation bears on regional development , people 's well-being and the future of the world .
This year , an important task for APEC is to launch a vision of cooperation beyond 2020 , and we have achieved our goal of jointly building an Asia-Pacific community .
We should take this as a new starting point , start a new stage of Asia-Pacific cooperation , continue the strong momentum of development in the Asia-Pacific region , and embrace a prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region .
First , we must remain open and inclusive .
The world economy , like the Pacific Ocean around us , brings together thousands of rivers and connects the four seas , creating a vast and broad mind and giving birth to the surging vitality of the waves .
Cooperation based on treating each other as equals and resolving differences on the basis of mutual respect are fundamental to the economic development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region .
Along the way , APEC is committed to promoting regional economic integration , has made great progress in implementing the Bogor Goals , and has also played an important role in guiding the evolution of the multilateral trading system .
But free and open trade and investment cannot be achieved overnight .
The Asia-Pacific region should continue to take the lead in upholding peace and stability , safeguarding multilateralism and building an open world economy.You will unswervingly support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core , promote free and open trade and investment , and steer economic globalization towards a more open , inclusive , balanced and win-win direction .
We will continue to promote regional economic integration and establish an Asia-Pacific free trade area at an early date .
China welcomes the completion of the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) Agreement and will actively consider accession to the CPTPP .
While we promote free and open trade , economic and technological cooperation must not be relaxed .
We will continue to implement the APEC high-quality growth strategy and inclusive action agenda , accommodate the concerns of developing members , pay special attention to the special difficulties faced by women and other groups , support the development of small , medium and micro enterprises , and promote inclusive and sustainable growth .
China will hold a seminar on inclusive trade and investment to make recommendations on the broad benefits of trade and investment policies for the people .
We are ready to work with other parties to translate the relevant proposals into reality .
Second , we will stick to innovative growth .
Digital economy is the future development direction of the world , innovation is the wings of the Asia-Pacific economic take-off .
We should take the initiative to seize the opportunities of the times , bring into full play the characteristics of this region with its extensive human resources , sound technological base and large market potential , create new competitive advantages and open up new possibilities for people of all countries to lead a better life .
We need to fully implement the APEC Roadmap on Internet and Digital Economy.We need to promote the dissemination and application of new technologies , strengthen digital infrastructure and bridge the digital divide .
We should improve economic governance and create an open , fair , just and non-discriminatory business environment .
This year , China will carry out a case study on smart cities.We will promote the formulation of guiding principles on smart cities to provide a model for innovative urban development in the Asia-Pacific region .
China has put forward initiatives to encourage all parties to share their experience in fighting the epidemic and restoring the economy through digital technology.We advocate optimizing the digital business environment , invigorating market players , unleashing the potential of the digital economy and injecting new impetus into the economic recovery of the Asia-Pacific region .
Next year , China will hold a seminar on digital poverty reduction to give full play to the advantages of digital technology and help the Asia-Pacific region eradicate poverty .
Third , it insists on connectivity .
Connectivity is an important foundation for regional economic integration and a necessary condition for the realization of interconnected global development . Its importance is even more prominent in the context of the epidemic .
We will continue to implement the blueprint for connectivity of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) , smooth the orderly flow of people , goods , capital and data , and achieve seamless connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region .
China has opened with Indonesia , the Republic of Korea and Singapore the " Fast Track " for the flow of people during the epidemic period , and we will continue to build a network to facilitate the flow of people .
We should promote international mutual recognition of health information on epidemic prevention .
China is ready to work with other parties to actively and steadily promote the construction of a " green channel " for goods and improve the efficiency of customs clearance.We will open up the blocking and connecting points , promote the building of an international industrial chain and supply chain cooperation platform , and maintain the safe and smooth operation of global and regional industrial chains and supply chains .
We need to promote synergy between development plans and connectivity initiatives of all parties .
China is willing to work with all parties to jointly build the Belt and Road with high quality , build a broader platform for Asia-Pacific connectivity and inject stronger impetus into the Asia-Pacific and world economy .
Fourthly , win-win cooperation should be maintained .
The member states of the Asia-Pacific region are highly complementary in development and deeply integrate their interests .
Asia-Pacific economic cooperation is never a zero-sum game or a political game in which you lose or win , but a development platform in which mutual achievements and mutual benefits can be achieved and win-win progress can be made .
There is a Malaysian proverb , " When you climb mountains together , when you encounter ditches , you cross . "
That is the essence of the spirit of the Asia-Pacific community .
Once again , the epidemic has taught us that only unity and cooperation can overcome the challenge .
We will deepen the Asia-Pacific partnership featuring mutual trust , inclusiveness , cooperation and win-win results . Upholding the concept of extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits , you will continue to elevate the level of regional cooperation , enlarge the cake of Asia-Pacific cooperation and achieve common prosperity .
We need to advance pragmatic cooperation on the basis of consensus , properly handle contradictions and differences , maintain the right direction for Asia-Pacific cooperation and keep the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation stable and moving forward .
Coping with the epidemic is the most urgent task at present .
We need to strengthen vaccine research , development and exchange , work to make vaccines a global public good , and promote their accessibility and affordability in developing countries .
The Chinese side has joined the " New Crown Pneumonia Vaccine Implementation Plan " .
China supports APEC in strengthening policy exchanges and capacity building in such areas as public health and small , medium and micro enterprises , and puts forward an initiative on telemedicine so that people in poor and remote areas can receive timely and effective medical treatment , thus helping anti-epidemic cooperation and economic recovery .
China attaches great importance to the role of APEC and will continue to support its development .

Not long ago , the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) adopted the proposal on drawing up the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan , and put forward that the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be achieved as scheduled .

Comrades !
At the beginning of reform and opening to the outside world , our Party issued a great call to follow its own path and build socialism with Chinese characteristics .
Since then , our Party has united with and led the people of all ethnic groups in their unremitting struggle to bring China 's economic strength , scientific and technological strength , national defense strength and overall national strength into the forefront of the world .
To promote the unprecedented upgrading of China 's international status ,
The face of the Party , the face of the country , the face of the people , the face of the army and the face of the Chinese nation have undergone unprecedented changes .
After a long period of hard work , socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era , which is the new historical orientation of China 's development .
The entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into the new era means that the long-suffering Chinese nation since modern times has ushered in a great leap from standing up , getting rich to becoming strong , ushered in a bright prospect of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation ;
It means that scientific socialism has shown great vitality in China in the 21st century and raised the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics at a high level in the world .
It means the continuous development of the road , theory , system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics and expands the way for the developing countries to move towards modernization .
It has provided new choices for countries and ethnic groups in the world who wish to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence , and has contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to the solution of human problems .
This new era is an era in which the great victories of socialism with Chinese characteristics are won by carrying forward the past and starting from the present , carrying forward the past and continuing to win under new historical conditions .
Is a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way , and then the construction of a strong socialist modernization era ,
It is an era in which the people of all ethnic groups work together to create a better life and gradually realize the common prosperity of all the people .
It is an era when all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation will act in concert and strive to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation . It is an era when China is getting closer to the center of the world stage and making greater contributions to mankind .
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era , and the principal contradiction in our society has been transformed into a contradiction between the people 's ever-increasing need for a better life and their uneven and inadequate development .
China has solved the problem of food and clothing for more than one billion people in a stable way . On the whole , we have achieved a well-off society , which will soon be a well-off society in all respects .
The need for a better life for the people is becoming more and more widespread ,
You have not only put higher demands on your material and cultural life , but also increasingly on democracy , the rule of law , fairness , justice , security , the environment and so on .
At the same time , the level of our social productive forces has on the whole improved markedly , and our social productive capacity has entered the forefront of the world in many respects .
Even more striking is the inadequacy of development imbalances , which have become a major constraint in meeting the growing needs of people for a better life .
I must realize that the change of the principal contradiction in our society is a historic change that has a bearing on the overall situation of the country .
We should , on the basis of continued promotion of development , work hard to address the imbalance and inadequacy of development and improve the quality and efficiency of development .
We will better meet the growing economic , political , cultural , social and ecological needs of the people and promote their all-round development and social progress .
I must realize that the changes in the principal contradictions of our society have not changed our judgment of the historical stage of socialism in our country .
China 's basic national conditions , which are still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come , remain unchanged , and China 's international status as the world 's largest developing country remains unchanged .
The whole Party must firmly grasp the basic national conditions of the primary stage of socialism and we must firmly base ourselves on the biggest reality of the primary stage of socialism .
You have firmly adhered to the Party 's basic line , the lifeline of the Party and the country and the line of happiness of the people .
I lead and unite the people of all ethnic groups , focusing on economic development ,
I am committed to the Four Cardinal Principles and to reform and opening-up , and you will work hard and self-reliantly to build China into a strong , prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced , harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country .

It is of great significance in the history of the development of the Chinese nation , as well as in the history of world socialism and human society .
The whole Party should strengthen confidence and work hard to make socialism with Chinese characteristics display stronger vitality .
Second , the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new era
A hundred years ago , the October Revolution sent Marxism-Leninism to China with a cannon .
The Chinese advanced elements have seen from the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism the way out for us to solve China 's problems .
In the fierce movement of Chinese society since modern times , in the fierce struggle of the Chinese people against feudal rule and foreign aggression , and in the course of the integration of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese workers ' movement , the Communist Party of China came into being in 1921 .
Since then , the Chinese people have taken the lead in their struggle for national independence , liberation , national prosperity and strength , and people 's happiness .
The Chinese nation has a civilization history of more than 5,000 years.We have created a splendid Chinese civilization , made outstanding contributions to mankind , and we have become a great nation in the world .
After the Opium War , China was plunged into a dark state of internal and external sufferings , and the Chinese people experienced heavy suffering caused by frequent wars , broken mountains and rivers and people 's livelihood .
For the sake of national rejuvenation , innumerable benevolent men and women have waged heroic struggles and made all kinds of attempts , but in the end they have failed to change the social character of the old China and the tragic fate of the Chinese people .

You united and led the people in an arduous struggle and composed a magnificent epic poem engulfing mountains and rivers .

It has laid the fundamental political premise and institutional foundation for all development and progress in contemporary China .
Realized the Chinese nation from the modern times continue to decline to fundamentally reverse the fate of continued prosperity and strength of the great leap .
Our Party is deeply aware that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation must conform to the trend of the times , the will of the people and the courage to reform and open up .
Let the cause of the Party and the people always be imbued with a strong impetus to forge ahead .
Our Party united with and led the people in the great new revolution of reform and opening to the outside world , broke through all the ideological and institutional obstacles blocking the development of the country and the nation , and blazed a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics ,

Half a mile makes half a mile .
The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can never be achieved with ease and by beating the drums .
The whole Party must be prepared to make even harder and harder efforts .
To achieve a great dream , it must wage a great struggle .
Society is advancing in contradictory movements ,
If it has contradictions , there will be struggles .
In order for the Party to unite and lead the people to effectively meet major challenges , resist major risks , overcome major obstacles and resolve major contradictions , we must wrestle with great struggles with many new historical characteristics .
