T-21	To identify how poverty alleviation should be carried out , we have put forward five key measures to lift people out of poverty : some by increasing production ; some through relocation ; some through ecological compensation ; some through education ; and some by providing allowances to assist them in meeting their basic needs . We have also alleviated poverty by boosting employment , improving medical services , and helping people earn returns on assets , etc . Overall , we have tailored initiatives to the needs of different localities and individuals , providing people with what they are missing and allowing them to do what they are capable of doing , thus alleviating poverty by getting to the root of the problem .

T-26	First , we have promoted exits from poverty in an orderly manner . The number of rural residents living below the current poverty line decreased from 98.99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018 , a total reduction of 82.39 million . An average of more than ten million people have been lifted out of poverty each year for six years running , and poverty rate has dropped from 10.2 % to 1.7 % . We have changed the former trend toward a year-on-year decrease in the number of people being lifted out of poverty after adopting new standards for exiting poverty , and broken the bottleneck that existed in the past two rounds of poverty alleviation in which we were unable to further reduce the poor population when it dropped to about 30 million .

The incidence of poverty has been reduced from 10.2 % to 1.7 % , reversing the trend of reducing the number of poverty-stricken people every year since the implementation of the new standards in the past , and breaking the bottleneck whereby the number of poverty-stricken people in the first two rounds of poverty reduction has been reduced to about 30 million .
