Speech at the Colloquium on Solving the Outstanding Problems of " Two Worries and Three Guarantees "
Xi Jinping
16 April 2019
Today , we hold an inter-provincial symposium to combat poverty .
This is the sixth time since the 18th Party Congress that I have presided over such a conference .
Before that , I had hosted such a forum successively in Yan 'an , Guiyang , Yinchuan , Taiyuan and Chengdu , and had received remarkable results .
Convening the symposium , mainly to consider that less than two years remain before the goal of poverty eradication can be achieved , 2019 will be particularly critical .
This year 's work to achieve a position , next year to lift out of poverty and strive for a comprehensive official will have a more solid foundation .
Yesterday at noon , I first went to Shizhu Tujia Autonomous County , inspected the primary school in Zhongyi Township , visited the poor families and the old Party members in Huaxi Village , held discussions with village representatives , grassroots cadres , help-the-poor cadres and village doctors , learned about the progress of Chongqing 's anti-poverty work and solved the outstanding problems of " two worries and three guarantees " , and had some intuitive feelings about Chongqing 's anti-poverty work .
The task of this meeting is to analyze the current situation of lifting people out of poverty , and to study and solve the outstanding problems of " two , two and three guarantees " .
The symposium was attended by secretaries of the Party committees of the eight provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities in Guangxi , Chongqing , Sichuan , Guizhou , Yunnan , Shaanxi , Gansu and Xinjiang , as well as grass-roots representatives from counties and villages in Chongqing , and leading comrades in charge of relevant departments of the Central Government .
Just now , you have introduced the situation , analyzed the problem , put forward suggestions and suggestions , and made a very good speech .
First , accurately grasp the situation of poverty alleviation
Since the 18th CPC National Congress , the Central Committee of the Party has made a series of major arrangements to lift the poor out of poverty and attack hard people in an all-round way as the bottom line task and a landmark target for building a well-off society .
After the 19th CPC National Congress , the CPC Central Committee regarded the fight to eradicate poverty accurately as one of the three major battles for building a well-off society in an all-round way .
In recent years , the scale , scale and impact of the fight against poverty have been unprecedented , and progress has been in line with expectations .
In November 2015 , at the conference on poverty alleviation and development held by the central government , we made it clear that by 2020 , we would " ensure that the poverty-stricken people in rural areas can be lifted out of poverty by the current standards in our country , that all the poverty-stricken counties take off their hats , and that regional poverty as a whole can be solved " .
At the meeting , I proposed that we should focus on solving the four problems of " who should support " , " who should help " , " how to help " and " how to get rid of poverty " .
At present , these problems have been solved relatively well .
In order to solve the problem of " who should be supported " , we have adhered to the principle of poverty alleviation in a precise and accurate manner , carried out village-by-household poverty identification , and set up filing cards for the identified poor villages and households . Through " looking back " and screening and adjustment , the identification accuracy rate has been continuously improved .
To solve the problem of " who will help " , China has selected more than 3 million cadres from government organs at or above the county level and state-owned enterprises and institutions to take part in the resident village help.At present , 206,000 first secretaries and 700,000 resident village cadres are on duty , together with 1.794 million township and village help-the-poor cadres and millions of village cadres , the frontline help-the-poor force has been notably strengthened , thus smoothing out the " last mile " of precise help-the-poor work .
In order to solve the problem of " how to help " , we propose to carry out the " five batches " projects , i.e. , to develop production and eliminate poverty , to relocate and remove poverty , to compensate for ecological problems , to develop education and eliminate poverty , to provide social security support , to help the poor by employment , to help the poor by health , to help the poor by income from assets , etc .
To solve the problem of how to withdraw , I put forward four words : set a timetable , set a buffer period , carry out strict evaluation , implement the house-to-house sales number .
We defined the criteria and procedures for the withdrawal of the poverty-stricken counties , villages and people living in poverty , gave guidance to all localities in scientifically and rationally drawing up rolling poverty-reduction plans and annual plans , and organized third parties to make strict evaluation of the poverty-stricken counties to be withdrawn , and the relevant policies remained stable .
Judging from the situation reflected in various aspects , the results of the counties that have announced the removal of hats are solid .
On the whole , the success of the fight against poverty is obvious .
Under the current standards , the number of poverty-stricken people in rural areas has been reduced from 98.99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018 , a total reduction of 8.239 million , and the annual poverty reduction scale has been above 10 million for six consecutive years . The incidence of poverty has been reduced from 10.2 % to 1.7 % , reversing the trend of reducing the number of poverty-stricken people every year since the implementation of the new standards in the past , and breaking the bottleneck whereby the number of poverty-stricken people in the first two rounds of poverty reduction has been reduced to about 30 million .
Of the 832 poverty-stricken counties in China , 153 have announced that they will remove their hats , and 284 are undergoing evaluation to remove their hats , thus changing the situation in which more and more impoverished counties are receiving assistance .
This year , China will complete the task of reducing poverty by more than 10 million people in 330 counties , and by early 2020 it is estimated that there will be only about 6 million poverty-stricken people and more than 60 impoverished counties in China .
Second , " two do not worry about " the overall realization .
It should be said that it has been widely done to ensure that the poor people are well fed and clothed , and that the problems besetting them in such areas as difficulty in travelling , drinking water , electricity , telecommunications , school attendance , access to health care and living in dangerous housing have been fairly well solved in most areas .
Third , the task of relocation and construction of the land is about to be completed .
During the 13th Five-Year Plan period , we planned to relocate some 10 million poverty-stricken people with construction documents from places where " one side of the river and one side of the soil can not feed one person , " and by the end of last year , 8.7 million poverty-stricken people had already been relocated .
Fourth , the Party 's governance base in the countryside has been further consolidated .
A large number of cadres have been hammered out in the arduous battle to get rid of poverty , the rallying power and combat effectiveness of rural grassroots Party organizations have been strengthened , the governance capacity and management level of rural grassroots organizations have been markedly improved , and the relationship between the Party and cadres at all levels has been constantly improved .
Our achievements and experience in poverty alleviation have contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese plans to the global cause of poverty reduction , demonstrated the political advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and our socialist system , won high praise from the international community , and many countries and international organizations have expressed their wish to share China 's experience in poverty reduction .
Of the developing countries , only China has achieved rapid development in tandem with large-scale poverty reduction , and the poor people share the fruits of reform and development .
While recognizing our achievements , we should also be fully aware of the difficulties and problems we face in winning the battle against poverty in an all-round way .
The first category is the problems that directly affect the achievement of the goal of poverty eradication .
For example , the anti-poverty standard is not accurate to grasp , some lower the standard , did not realize the " two do not have to worry about three guarantees " declared anti-poverty , more high standards , such as relocation areas oversize standards , medical care does not cost , free education , etc . , out of the country is unsustainable .
For example , the task of poverty eradication in the poverty-stricken areas is still arduous , with 1.72 million poor people in 鈥渢hree regions鈥 ? and 鈥渢hree regions鈥 ? still living in poverty with archival filing cabinets鈥 ? accounting for 12.5 percent of the total number of poverty-stricken people nationwide , and the incidence of poverty is 8.2 percent .
There are also 98 counties in China where the incidence of poverty is more than 10 percent , and 3.596 million poor people living in poverty have set up filing cards , accounting for 26 percent of the country 's total .
For instance , the " three guarantees " work is not solid , and there are still weak links in compulsory education , basic medical care , housing and drinking water safety.Now , 14 percent of the poor people in China need to solve the problem of the " three guarantees " .
In addition , after removing poverty and removing hats , work was relaxed , and in some hat-picking counties stalls , baggage , and rest were removed . In some hat-picking counties , energy and materials were not used to consolidate achievements , but rather to lavish and waste gonggong .
The second category concerns issues that require further improvement in the work .
For example , the problem of failing to fulfill the key responsibilities for poverty eradication , implementing policies , and carrying out work , as well as formalism and bureaucratism , the problem of digital poverty eradication , false poverty eradication and the problem of embezzlement and misappropriation of funds for poverty eradication are just some of the problems .
The third category is those that need to be addressed gradually over the long term .
For example , the foundation of industrial development is weak , the follow-up assistance measures for poverty alleviation and relocation are weak , the long-term mechanism for stabilizing poverty eradication has not been established , the internal dynamics of poor people are insufficient , and old customs and habits are difficult to change .
These problems , which must be solved urgently if they are able to be solved in a proper way and with a clear sense of priority , should not hamper the accomplishment of the basic tasks for poverty eradication ; some of the problems are long-term in nature and cannot be exhausted during the period of the endeavor , but overall arrangements should be made to create conditions for a gradual solution by stages .
Second , focus on solving the outstanding problems of " two not worried about three guarantees "
By 2020 , it will be possible to ensure that the poverty-stricken people in rural areas have enough to eat and wear ; that compulsory education , basic medical care and housing are guaranteed ; and that this is the basic requirement and core target for the poverty-stricken people to get rid of poverty , which has a direct bearing on the quality of the battle against poverty .
On the whole , the " two do not worry " has been basically resolved , " three guarantees " there are still many weak links .
With regard to the guarantee of compulsory education , more than 600,000 children throughout the country dropped out of compulsory education .
The construction of boarding schools in townships is weak , and some children left behind have difficulty in going to school .
With regard to basic medical care , some poverty-stricken people do not take part in basic medical insurance ; some poverty-stricken people do not receive timely treatment for common and chronic diseases ; the medical facilities in poor counties and villages are weak ; and some poverty-stricken villages do not have clinics or qualified village doctors .
In terms of housing safety and security , there are about 1.6 million households in four key categories that need to be reconstructed , including about 800,000 poor households with stowage cards .
Some local agricultural houses did not carry out the dangerous house appraisal , or the appraisal is not allowed .
With regard to drinking water safety , there are about 1.04 million poor people living in poverty whose drinking water safety problem remains unresolved , and 60 million rural people across the country need to consolidate and improve their drinking water safety .
If these problems are not properly addressed by 2020 , they will undermine the success of the fight against poverty .
All departments in all regions should attach great importance to the above issues , unify their thinking and do a good job in their implementation .
To solve the outstanding problems of the " three guarantees " , we must adhere to the institutional mechanism featuring overall planning by the central government , overall responsibility by the provinces , and implementation by the cities and counties .
The Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation should strengthen overall coordination , supervise and guide the work and dispatch the situation in a timely manner .
The Ministry of Education , the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development , the Ministry of Water Resources , the National Health and Health Commission and the National Medical Insurance Bureau are not only the component departments of the Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation , but also the competent departments for the " Three Guarantees " work .
According to the function of the department , clear working standards and support policy , guide the location to conduct screening solutions .
The provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities concerned shall organize grass-roots organizations to carry out verifications , map out basic conditions , make overall plans for organizing resources , formulate implementation plans and study and propose specific measures .
The city and county organize the implementation , each item to each account to cancel the number to ensure that there is no dead end .
I have stressed many times that we should adhere to the current poverty eradication standard and neither raise it to a higher level nor lower it .
The guarantee of compulsory education is mainly to keep the children of poor families in compulsory education from dropping out of school ;
To ensure that basic medical care is guaranteed , it is mainly the poor people who participate in the medical insurance system and can afford to see and see common and chronic diseases in places where they can live a decent life after suffering from serious or serious diseases ;
The security of housing is mainly to keep the poor from living in precarious housing ;
Drinking water security is mainly to let the rural population to drink safe water , coordinated research to solve the problem of drinking water security .
This is the basic standard of national unity , but the situation varies from place to place .
For example , you have security of housing , southern housing to pay attention to ventilation , northern housing to pay attention to warmth ;
To ensure the safety of drinking water , the Northwest region to focus on the problem of drinking water , the Southwest region to focus on the problem of water supply and water quality standards .
All localities should be carried out in conjunction with the actual grasp , not one size fits all .
Various places have made a lot of explorations in solving the outstanding problems of the " Three Guarantees " , and some places have unintentionally or intentionally raised the bar .
To obviously exceed the standard , should be corrected ; to not significantly exceed the standard , to maintain policy stability , continuity , less " over the cake . "
To solve the outstanding problem of " two not worried about three guarantees " , to find out the base number is the foundation , some places the base number is still not very clear , it is not good .
The departments concerned shall guide the localities in mapping out the basic figures to ensure that the work is well-targeted .
The departments concerned should strengthen the data alignment , not a number of departments .
The competent departments of the trades and professions shall take the lead in drawing up the work programs , and the provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities shall formulate the implementation programs , set clear time frames and road maps , and come up with effective measures and methods to ensure that the tasks are completed on time .
The policies and funds for solving the outstanding problems of the " Three Guarantees " are sufficient , and the key is to do their best to implement them .
You should increase the intensity of work , focus on outstanding issues , village-by-household item leak to fill in gaps , fill up short board .
We need to publicize policies and standards , unify our thinking and understanding , and guide all sectors of society to understand accurately .
Third , we will do a solid job of lifting people out of poverty this year and next
On the whole , China has basically achieved the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way , but there are still some shortcomings , the biggest shortcoming is to fight poverty .
Now , the battle to eradicate poverty has entered a crucial stage of decisive victory.To combat poverty , it must be distinguished from the comprehensive deployment in the initial period and the comprehensive push in the medium term .
All the departments in the regions must work together and fight tenaciously , and never collect troops unless they win a total victory .
First , we must strengthen the implementation of our responsibilities .
" Do not be wise first , but anxious . "
Poverty alleviation is a hard task to be accomplished in order to build a well-off society in an all-round way .
Party and government leaders in all provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities should strengthen their " Four Consciousness " , steadfastly " Four Confidence " and " Two Guarantees " , intensify their political responsibilities and work together to fight hard to get rid of poverty .
Responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation at the provincial level have special posts . You should be familiar with the situation , drill into the business , be a good staff officer and assistant , and do a good job of implementation .
Responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation in the provinces should select and match strong , maintain stability in principle , and make some adjustments to those who are not suitable or competent .
All industrial departments should focus on the task of fighting poverty , fulfill their duties conscientiously and work together to attack poverty in accordance with the requirement of fighting to the best of their ability , and hold accountable those who fail to carry out their responsibilities , policies or work that affect the accomplishment of their tasks .
Second , to conquer the hard core .
The poverty-stricken areas have a deep poverty level , poor basic conditions and complicated causes , as well as interwoven ethnic , religious and stability issues , which is the key to whether the battle to eradicate poverty can be won or not .
In June 2017 , I hosted a symposium in Shanxi Province on poverty alleviation in poverty-stricken areas , calling for a concentrated effort to overcome the deep-poverty bastions of " three regions , three states " and so on .
After the meeting , the Central Committee of the Party formulated the implementation opinions to support the poverty-stricken areas in their efforts to get rid of poverty .
Some deeply poverty-stricken counties outside the " three regions and three prefectures " should intensify their work , study on a case-by-case basis detailed measures for tackling key problems in a practical way , attack their cities and pull out their strongholds , and ensure the accomplishment of the task of poverty eradication .
Third , we should seriously rectify the problem .
This special inspection and effectiveness evaluation of poverty alleviation have found a lot of outstanding problems and common problems , mainly in the following aspects .
First , we have not taken poverty eradication as a major political task , and the implementation of our responsibilities is not yet in place , with gaps in our thinking and understanding and weak implementation .
The second is the implementation of the precision of the method is slightly out of line , or the issue of money " a hair " , or a unified share of dividends " a hair " , or the bottom of the low-security pocket " a pocket " , do not spend energy on embroidery .
Third , formalism and bureaucracy are prominent problems , such as spending money to whitewash walls , not eating and not wearing , doing these useless work , wasting the country 's money !
There were many meetings , inspections and forms filled out , and cadres at the grass-roots level were struggling to cope .
All departments in all regions should thoroughly examine and sort out the problems , all kinds of problems to ensure that the rectification is in place , for next year 's work to lay a good foundation .
Fourth , improve the quality of poverty eradication .
Poverty eradication depends not only on quantity but also on quality , so we cannot always say that we have completed the task of poverty eradication and will return to poverty in a big way in a year or two .
You need to improve the quality of poverty eradication through multi-pronged approaches and consolidate the achievements made in this regard .
It is necessary to pull poverty out of the country strictly , and strictly implement the criteria and procedures for doing so to ensure that we truly and truly get rid of poverty .
We should give high priority to preventing the return of poverty-stricken people , timely organize a " look back " campaign for the people who have been lifted out of poverty , and give timely assistance to the returned and newly emerging poor people .
We will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism to stabilize poverty eradication , intensify poverty alleviation through industry , organize consumer relief , intensify training , promote employment transfer and provide stable jobs for the poor .
You should do a good job in the relocation of poverty relief follow-up assistance . You should strengthen the combination of poverty alleviation and the support of the spirit of wisdom , so that poverty eradication has a sustainable endogenous drive .
Fifth , the policy of lifting people out of poverty in a stable manner is crucial .
" It is not difficult to win , but also difficult to hold .
In the first half of this year , a total of more than 430 impoverished counties will announce that they have removed their hats .
The examination found that some counties had been sluggish since last year , some had withdrawn their stalls and rested their feet , some had shifted their centre of gravity and replaced their channels , some secretaries and county heads had hoped to move , and some of the people who had been lifted out of poverty did not see their incomes rise or even fall .
After the poverty-stricken counties remove their hats , they must continue to accomplish the task of lifting the remaining poverty-stricken people out of poverty so as to realize the goal of lifting the poverty-stricken people out of poverty in a stable way .
The Party and government of the poverty-stricken counties should maintain stability and ensure that they accept no responsibility to remove their hats ; the major policy to fight against poverty should continue to be implemented and that they accept no responsibility to remove their hats ; the poverty alleviation task forces should not be able to remove their hats , and they should help and assist the poor .
The departments concerned should pay close attention to studying and putting forward suggestions for implementation .
Sixth , improve the style of work .
It is necessary to run the whole process of lifting people out of poverty strictly according to the requirements of the Party in an all-round way and strengthen the work style so as to ensure that the work is pragmatic , that the process of lifting people out of poverty is solid and that the results are real .
We should improve and implement the institutional mechanism by which the Party is urged to build to lift people out of poverty , do a good job in training cadres to lift people out of poverty , and enhance their sense of responsibility , mission and ability to work .
It is necessary to give play to the role of primary Party organizations as a stronghold in guiding the masses to shake off poverty and get rich , and deepen special governance on the issue of corruption and work style in the field of poverty alleviation so as to translate into reality the various decisions on reducing responsibilities at the primary level .
Most of the cadres on the front line of poverty alleviation bear in mind the importance of their mission , and exchange their hard work for the happiness of the poor masses . Some of them have been operating beyond their capacity for a long time , some have not had time to take care of their family children , some have been overstretched and given red lights , and some have even sacrificed their precious lives .
To our comrades who are fighting hard to break away from poverty , we should pay close attention to their life , health and safety , and give timely pensions and long-term assistance to the families of cadres who have lost their lives .
Cadres who have made achievements and are welcomed by the masses at the grass-roots level should be carefully trained and used .
You should strengthen publicity and commendation , and tell a good story of breaking out of poverty .
At the same time , it is necessary to strengthen the management of education for the help-the-poor cadres who are timid and fearful , perfunctory and hypocritical , to replace them in a timely manner and to hold them firmly accountable .
To win the battle against poverty is a glorious and arduous historical task , and arduous efforts will continue to be made to win the battle in an all-round way .
We should work hard and make more contributions to winning the battle against poverty in an all-round way and building a well-off society in an all-round way as scheduled .
Constructing a New Development Pattern to Achieve Mutual Benefit and Win-win
- Keynote Speech at APEC Business Leaders Dialogue
President Xi Jinping of the People 's Republic of China
Beijing , 19 November 2020
Ladies and Gentlemen , Friends of Business and Industry :
It is a great pleasure to meet you by video at this important moment when the world is jointly fighting the SARS epidemic and exploring the road to world economic recovery .
Humans are in a special historical period . The global pandemic of SARS has accelerated the evolution of a situation that has not changed in the world in a century .
The world economy is in deep recession , global industrial chains and supply chains have suffered shocks , and governance , trust , development and peace deficits are widening .
Unilateralism , protectionism and bullying are on the rise , and economic globalization is encountering adverse trends , exacerbating risks and uncertainties in the world economy .
At the same time , the theme of the era of peace and development has not changed , and cooperation in meeting challenges is the only choice of the international community .
The epidemic has once again demonstrated that mankind shares a common destiny , that the interests of all countries are closely linked and that the world is an indivisible community of shared future .
Whether winning the final victory against the global epidemic or promoting the recovery of the world economy , the international community must unite and work together to meet the test of the crisis .
All countries should stand by one another and help each other in times of difficulty , carry forward the spirit of partnership , strengthen policy communication and coordination , comprehensively deepen international cooperation against the epidemic , persist in building an open world economy , strive to overcome the epidemic at an early date , and strive to achieve strong , sustainable , balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy .
Since the beginning of this year , in the face of the sudden epidemic , China has adhered to the principle of putting people first and life first , and 1.4 billion people have made great strategic achievements in the national fight against the epidemic .
We made overall plans for the prevention and control of the epidemic situation and economic and social development , and paid close attention to restoring order in production and life .
In the first three quarters , China 's economic growth turned negative to positive .
This is a hard-won achievement that has fully demonstrated the resilience and dynamism of China 's economy .
The fundamentals of China 's economic development , which have been improving steadily and steadily for a long time , remain unchanged . We have every confidence and ability to maintain steady economic growth and achieve the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and winning the battle against poverty in a timely manner .
Not long ago , the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) adopted the proposal on drawing up the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan , and put forward that the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be achieved as scheduled . Next year , China will embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects .
We have made a strategic choice in structuring the new development pattern by taking full account of economic globalization and changes in the external environment on the basis of China 's own stage of development and its own development conditions .
First , we will turn around the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand and smooth the national economic cycle .
In recent years , China ’ s pattern of development has been quietly changing , with dependence on foreign trade falling from 67 % in 2006 to nearly 32 % in 2019 , and the current-account surplus to GDP ratio falling from 9.9 % in 2007 to less than 1 % today .
Since the 2008 international financial crisis , China 's domestic demand has contributed more than 100 % to economic growth in seven years , and domestic consumption has been the main engine of economic growth .
In the process of promoting the economic double cycle , China 's economic autonomy and development quality have improved markedly , and the construction of a new development pattern has responded to the inherent need of China 's economic restructuring and promoting high-quality development .
We will continue to deepen supply-side structural reform , make greater efforts to expand domestic demand , make production , distribution , circulation and consumption more dependent on the domestic market , enhance the adaptability of the supply system to domestic demand , and create a higher level of dynamic equilibrium in which demand drives supply and supply creates demand .
Second , we will vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation to create new impetus for economic development .
At present , a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation are accelerating development , and the contribution of science and technology to the improvement of social productive forces has become more prominent .
China adheres to taking innovation as the first driving force for development , and has made remarkable achievements in promoting innovation-driven development strategy .
As China enters a new stage of development , the factors and conditions that support development have undergone profound changes , and it is necessary to achieve connotative growth driven by innovation .
We will build an innovation system featuring close integration of science and technology , education , industry and finance , constantly upgrade the level of the industrial chain and provide strong support for China 's long-term economic development by relying on the advantages of ultra-large scale markets and improving the industrial system , so as to speed up the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into the real productive forces .
Third , we will continue to deepen reform and fully stimulate market vitality .
The practice of reform and opening up over 40 years ago shows that reform is the key to liberating and developing the productive forces of society .
As China enters a new stage of development and its reform is confronted with new tasks , we will show greater courage and take more measures to remove the deep-seated institutional and institutional obstacles and modernize China 's governance system and capacity .
We will constantly improve our ability and level to implement the new concept of innovation , coordination , green , open and shared development , change our mode of development , promote changes in quality , efficiency and motivation , speed up the building of a modern economic system , strengthen the protection of property and intellectual property rights , set up a high standard market system , improve the fair competition system , and let the vitality of market players of all kinds flow in full .
Ladies and gentlemen , friends !
Openness is a prerequisite for national progress , and isolation inevitably leads to backwardness .
In today 's world , the trend of economic globalization is irreversible , and no country can engage in construction behind closed doors .
We will never go back to history and seek to " decouple " or " close " exclusive " circles .
To build a new development pattern is not a closed domestic single cycle , but an open and mutually reinforcing domestic and international double cycle .
Under the new development pattern , the potential of the Chinese market will be fully tapped to create more demand for other countries .
China 's per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) has exceeded $ 10,000 , with more than 400 million middle-income people , and many international agencies expect the retail market to reach $ 6 trillion this year .
The continuous development of China 's economy and the Chinese people 's pursuit of a better life will create more demand for more diversified and high-quality products , technologies and services from all over the world .
Despite the impact of the epidemic , China 's imports of goods trade has basically recovered to the same level last year .
In September this year , the China International Service Trade Fair was held in Beijing , attracting 22,000 enterprises and institutions from 148 countries and regions to attend the fair online and offline .
Not long ago , the 3rd China International Import Expo ( CIIE ) was successfully held in Shanghai , with enterprises from 124 countries and regions participating . The exhibition area was further expanded and the turnover increased to 7.2.62 billion US dollars .
We will further reduce tariffs and institutional costs , foster import trade and innovation demonstration zones , and expand imports of high-quality products and services to all countries .
We believe that with the development of potentials of the Chinese market , China will provide a broader market opportunity for all countries and a stronger driving force for the steady development of the world economy .
Under the new development pattern , China will open its door wider to share development opportunities with other countries .
Opening up to the outside world is China 's basic state policy and will not be shaken at any time .
Since the beginning of this year , in the face of increasing uncertainties and uncertainties in the world economy and the spread of unilateralism and protectionism , China has not stopped its opening-up , and has launched a series of policy measures to expand opening-up , including the full implementation of the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing regulations , further reducing the negative list of foreign investment admission , steadily promoting financial market access , introducing the overall plan for building a free trade port in Hainan , strengthening the reform and opening-up measures in Shenzhen and Pudong , and deepening the pilot project for innovation and development in service trade .
I would like to reiterate that China 's determination to open up to the outside world is unwavering and the door will open wider and wider .
We will continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation , negotiate and sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries , actively participate in more bilateral regional investment and trade cooperation mechanisms , and build an open economy of a higher level .
We will improve the system of administration of national treatment plus negative list before foreign investment is admitted , protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign-capital enterprises in accordance with the law , open up in an orderly way the service sector to the outside world , and create a continuously market-oriented , law-based and internationalized business environment .
The Pilot Free Trade Zone should be given greater autonomy in reform and opening up to the outside world .
At the same time , we will continue to firmly support the multilateral trading system , take a more active part in the reform of the global economic governance system and work for the establishment of a fairer and more equitable international economic governance system .
Under the new development pattern , China 's foreign cooperation will continue to deepen and achieve mutual benefit and win-win progress with other countries .
We will take a more active part in the international division of labor , integrate ourselves more effectively into the global industrial , supply and value chains , and expand exchanges and cooperation with other countries on our own initiative .
We will actively carry out cooperation with all countries , regions and enterprises willing to cooperate with China .
We will continue to hold high the banner of openness and cooperation , adhere to multilateralism and the principle of extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits , promote high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road , synergize development strategies and connectivity plans of various countries and regions , strengthen integration of policies , rules and standards , and deepen practical cooperation with other countries in infrastructure construction , industry , economy and trade , scientific and technological innovation , public health and people-to-people and cultural exchanges . We will turn the Belt and Road into a path of cooperation , a path of health , a path of recovery and growth , strengthen cooperation on green development and contribute to promoting common development of the world and building a community with a shared future for mankind .
Ladies and gentlemen , friends !
It is in our common interest to safeguard peace and stability and promote development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region , which is our common home .
Countries in Asia and the Pacific have both the benefits of close human interaction and the advantages of being in a position to cross the ocean .
We have followed the laws of the market , seized the opportunities of economic globalization and regional economic integration , and led the way in world economic growth .
The development of the Asia-Pacific region and the deepening of regional economic cooperation are of profound historical inevitability , conform to the aspirations of the people of the Asia-Pacific countries and will continue to display strong vitality .
Last year , I proposed to build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future featuring openness , inclusiveness , innovative growth , connectivity and win-win cooperation .

Speech at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders ' Meeting
President Xi Jinping of the People 's Republic of China
Beijing , 20 November 2020
Distinguished Prime Minister Mushidin , colleagues :
I am pleased to be here by video link to thank Prime Minister Al-Mushidin and the Government of Malaysia for their efforts in preparing for this meeting .
Over the past 30 years or so since its establishment , APEC has witnessed accelerated changes in the world landscape and profound reshaping of global governance , as well as profound changes in the Asia-Pacific region .
Over the past 30 years , APEC cooperation has deepened and made great progress.Guided by the Bogor Goals , we have continued to enhance regional economic integration .
We will promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and economic and technological cooperation to turn the two wheels together and strive for complementary advantages and balanced development.We will advocate open regionalism and explore an " APEC Approach " featuring voluntariness , consensus , flexibility and pragmatism , and a gradual and orderly progress .
During this period , the Asia-Pacific region has withstood the tests of two financial crises , lifted more than 1 billion people out of poverty and become the strongest and most dynamic sector in world economic growth , playing a positive role in building an open world economy , supporting the multilateral trading system and guiding economic globalization .
At present , the world and the Asia-Pacific region are undergoing profound changes , and the outbreak of coronary pneumonia has accelerated this trend .
The world economy is in a downturn , economic globalization is encountering headwinds , unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise , contradictions such as fairness and efficiency , growth and distribution , technology and employment are more prominent , the gap between rich and poor is still wide , and the global governance system is facing new challenges .
For the first time in decades , the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing negative overall economic growth , which is an arduous task to protect the health of its people and realize economic recovery .
The way forward for Asia-Pacific cooperation bears on regional development , people 's well-being and the future of the world .
This year , an important task for APEC is to launch a vision of cooperation beyond 2020 , and we have achieved our goal of jointly building an Asia-Pacific community .
We should take this as a new starting point , start a new stage of Asia-Pacific cooperation , continue the strong momentum of development in the Asia-Pacific region , embrace a prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region , and jointly build an Asia-Pacific community of shared future featuring openness , inclusiveness , innovative growth , connectivity and win-win cooperation .
First , we must remain open and inclusive .
The world economy , like the Pacific Ocean around us , brings together thousands of rivers and connects the four seas , creating a vast and broad mind and giving birth to the surging vitality of the waves .
Cooperation on the basis of equal treatment and the settlement of differences on the basis of mutual respect are fundamental to the economic development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region .
Along the way , APEC is committed to promoting regional economic integration , has made great progress in implementing the Bogor Goals , and has played an important role in guiding the evolution of the multilateral trading system .
But free and open trade and investment cannot be achieved overnight .
The Asia-Pacific region should continue to lead the way in maintaining peace and stability , firmly safeguarding multilateralism and building an open world economy.It should unswervingly support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core , promote free and open trade and investment , and steer economic globalization towards a more open , inclusive , balanced and win-win direction .
We will continue to promote regional economic integration and establish an Asia-Pacific free trade area at an early date .
China welcomes the conclusion and signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) Agreement and will actively consider accession to the CPTPP .
While we promote free and open trade , economic and technological cooperation must not be relaxed .
We will continue to implement the APEC high-quality growth strategy and inclusive action agenda , accommodate the concerns of developing members , pay special attention to the special difficulties faced by women and other groups , support the development of small , medium and micro enterprises , and promote inclusive and sustainable growth .
China will hold a seminar on inclusive trade and investment to make recommendations on the broad benefits of trade and investment policies for the people .
We are ready to work with other parties to translate the relevant proposals into reality .
Second , we will stick to innovative growth .
Digital economy is the future development direction of the world , innovation is the wings of the Asia-Pacific economic take-off .
We should take the initiative to seize the opportunities of the times , bring into full play the characteristics of this region with its extensive human resources , sound technological base and large market potential , create new competitive advantages and open up new possibilities for people of all countries to lead a better life .
We need to fully implement the APEC Roadmap on Internet and Digital Economy , promote the dissemination and application of new technologies , strengthen digital infrastructure construction and bridge the digital divide .
We should improve economic governance and create an open , fair , just and non-discriminatory business environment .
The case study on smart cities carried out by China this year will promote the formulation of guiding principles for smart cities and provide a model for innovative urban development in the Asia-Pacific region .
China has put forward initiatives to encourage all parties to share their experience in fighting the epidemic and restoring the economy through digital technology.We advocate optimizing the digital business environment , invigorating market players , unleashing the potential of the digital economy and injecting new impetus into the economic recovery of the Asia-Pacific region .
Next year , China will hold a seminar on digital poverty reduction to give full play to the advantages of digital technology and help the Asia-Pacific region eradicate poverty .
Third , we must stay connected .
Connectivity is an important foundation for regional economic integration and a necessary condition for the realization of interconnected global development . Its importance is even more prominent in the context of the epidemic .
We will continue to implement the blueprint for connectivity of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) , smooth the orderly flow of people , goods , capital and data , and achieve seamless connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region .
China has opened with Indonesia , the Republic of Korea and Singapore the " Fast Track " for the flow of people during the epidemic period and will continue to build a network to facilitate the flow of people .
We should promote international mutual recognition of health information on epidemic prevention .
China is ready to work with other parties to push forward the construction of a " green channel " for goods , improve the efficiency of customs clearance , unblock and disconnect points , promote the building of an international industrial chain and supply chain cooperation platform , and maintain the safe and smooth operation of global and regional industrial chains and supply chains .
We need to promote synergy between development plans and connectivity initiatives of all parties .
China is willing to work with all parties to jointly build the Belt and Road with high quality , build a broader platform for Asia-Pacific connectivity and inject stronger impetus into the Asia-Pacific and world economy .
Fourthly , win-win cooperation should be maintained .
The member states of the Asia-Pacific region are highly complementary in development and deeply integrate their interests .
Asia-Pacific economic cooperation is never a zero-sum game or a political game in which you lose or win , but a development platform in which mutual achievements and mutual benefits can be achieved and win-win progress can be made .
There is a Malaysian proverb , " When you climb mountains together , when you encounter ditches , you cross . "
That is the essence of the spirit of the Asia-Pacific community .
Once again , the epidemic has taught us that only unity and cooperation can overcome the challenge .
We need to deepen the Asia-Pacific partnership featuring mutual trust , inclusiveness , cooperation and win-win results , uphold the concept of extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits , and continuously upgrade regional cooperation so as to make the pie of Asia-Pacific cooperation bigger and achieve common prosperity .
We need to advance practical cooperation on the basis of consensus , properly handle contradictions and differences , maintain the right direction for Asia-Pacific cooperation and keep the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation stable and moving forward .
Coping with the epidemic is the most urgent task at present .
We need to strengthen vaccine research , development and exchange , work to make vaccines a global public good , and promote their accessibility and affordability in developing countries .
The Chinese side has joined the " New Crown Pneumonia Vaccine Implementation Plan " .
China supports APEC in strengthening policy exchanges and capacity building in such areas as public health and small , medium and micro enterprises , and puts forward an initiative on telemedicine so that people in poor and remote areas can receive timely and effective medical treatment , thus helping anti-epidemic cooperation and economic recovery .
China attaches great importance to the role of APEC and will continue to support its development , firmly rooted in the Asia-Pacific region , building the Asia-Pacific region and bringing benefits to the Asia-Pacific region .
Dear Colleagues ,
This year , the Chinese people , through arduous and arduous efforts , have achieved significant strategic results in the fight against the epidemic .
China has worked hand in hand with other countries to overcome these difficulties and has contributed wisdom and strength to the global fight against the epidemic .
China has no reservations to share with all parties its experience in prevention , control and treatment , provide assistance to other countries and international organizations to the best of its ability , and take concrete actions to build a community of human health and health .
We made overall plans for the prevention and control of the epidemic as well as for economic and social development , strengthened our macro policy response , and promoted steady progress , gradual improvement and continuous upgrading of the Chinese economy .
This year , China 's economy grew 0.7 percent in the first three quarters of this year on a year-on-year basis.It is a foregone conclusion that China will achieve full and positive economic growth for the whole year , especially since under the current standards the poverty-stricken rural population will be lifted out of poverty in an all-round way .
Not long ago , the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) adopted the proposal on drawing up the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan , and put forward that the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be achieved as scheduled . Next year , China will embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects .
China will build a new open economy at a higher level and create a more attractive environment for investment and business .
China is ready to work with all parties in the Asia-Pacific region to create a bright future of peace , prosperity and shared benefits in the region and strive for a community with a shared future for mankind .

Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party , the Central Leading Group for the Response to the Epidemic Situation made timely research and deployment , the Central Steering Group strengthened guidance and supervision , the State Council 's joint prevention and control mechanism coordinated overall coordination , all regional departments performed their duties conscientiously , and all sectors of society gave full support to the development of the people 's war for the prevention and control of the epidemic , the overall war , and the battle of resistance .
Community workers , public security officers , cadres at the grass-roots level , journalists and volunteers held fast to their posts , and workers in the production and transportation of express delivery , sanitation and anti-epidemic materials spared no effort . Millions of ordinary workers made silent contributions . The people of Wuhan and Hubei persevered unswervingly . All sectors of society , compatriots from Hong Kong , Macao and Taiwan , and overseas Chinese donated money and goods .
The sons and daughters of the Chinese have built the lofty Great Wall to fight the epidemic by helping each other through thick and thin .
In the prevention and control of the epidemic , we have , in line with the general requirements of strengthening confidence , sharing weal and woe , scientific prevention and control and accurate policy implementation , grasped every aspect of our work as a matter of urgency .
Urgent measures will be taken in a timely manner to manage SARS , and first-level responses to major public health emergencies will be launched throughout the country .
We will resolutely win the defense war in Wuhan and Hubei and achieve decisive results.We will resolutely implement strict control measures and give full support to them with the entire nation 's force.We will send more than 40,000 medical personnel to build Mount Vulcan and Mount Leishen hospitals and square-cabin hospitals , rapidly expand hospital beds , give priority to medical supplies , constantly optimize medical treatment and treatment plans , adhere to the combination of Chinese and Western medicine , adhere to the principle of " four centralization " , and make every effort to treat patients , raise the cure rate to the maximum extent and reduce the mortality rate .

Delegates !
The achievements made in economic and social development since last year and in the prevention and control of this year 's epidemic situation are the result of the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core , the result of the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era , and the result of the concerted efforts of the whole Party , the armed forces and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .
On behalf of the State Council , I wish to express our sincere thanks to the people of all our ethnic groups , the democratic parties , people 's organizations and people from all walks of life .
I wish to express our sincere thanks to our compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region , the Macao Special Administrative Region , Taiwan and overseas Chinese .
I would like to express our sincere thanks to the governments , international organizations and friends from all over the world for their interest in supporting China 's modernization drive and the fight against the epidemic .
The global epidemic has hit the world economy with a severe recession , disrupted the supply chain and chain cycles , shrinking international trade and investment , and destabilized commodity markets .
Domestic consumption , investment and exports have declined , the pressure on employment has increased markedly , difficulties for enterprises , especially private enterprises and small , medium and micro enterprises , risks in financial and other fields have accumulated , and contradictions in the fiscal balance at the grass-roots level have intensified .
There are still shortcomings in government work.Formalism and bureaucratism are still prominent , and a small number of cadres do not carry out or act , or will not do or act in an unruly way .
Corruption is rampant in some areas .
In the prevention and control of epidemic diseases , public health emergency management and other aspects have revealed many weak links , and the public still has some opinions and suggestions that should be taken seriously .
We must do our utmost to improve our work , fulfill our duties and live up to the expectations of the people .
II . Major Development Goals for the Year and Overall Deployment for the Next Stage of Work
To do a good job in this year 's government , we must be under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core .
Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era ,
Fully implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the spirit of the Second , Third and Fourth Plenums of the 19th CPC Central Committee ,
We will resolutely implement the Party 's basic theory , line and strategy , enhance its " Four Consciousness " , firmly uphold its " Four Confidences " and achieve " Two Guarantees " .
Focusing on the task of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and promoting the prevention and control of the epidemic situation and economic and social development in an overall way ,
On the premise of normalizing the prevention and control of the epidemic situation , we will adhere to the general tone of the work of seeking progress in a steady way , adhere to the new concept of development , adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line , and adhere to the reform and opening up as the driving force to promote high-quality development ,
We will resolutely do a good job in tackling the three major challenges , intensify our work on the Six Stabilizers , ensure employment for residents , basic people 's livelihood , market subjects , food and energy security , supply chain stability and operation at the grass-roots level , resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand , safeguard the overall situation of economic development and social stability , ensure that the decisive battle will be won over the key task of poverty eradication and build a well-off society in an all-round way .
At present and in the coming period , China faces unprecedented risks and challenges in its development , but we have unique political and institutional advantages , a strong economic foundation , huge market potential and industrious wisdom on the part of hundreds of millions of people .
As long as we face up to the challenges , firmly develop confidence , enhance development momentum , and maintain and make good use of the important period of strategic opportunity for China 's development , the current difficulties will surely be overcome and China 's development will be full of hope .
Based on a comprehensive assessment of the situation , we have made appropriate adjustments to the expected objectives considered prior to the outbreak .
This year , we will give priority to securing employment and ensuring people 's livelihood , resolutely win the battle against poverty and strive to achieve the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects ;
More than 9 million new jobs have been created in cities and towns , with an urban unemployment rate of about 6 per cent and an urban registered unemployment rate of about 5.5 per cent .
Consumer prices rose by about 3.5 per cent ;
Import and export promote stability and quality , the balance of international payments is basically balanced ;
The income growth of residents and economic growth basically synchronized ;
Under the current standards , all poverty-stricken people in rural areas have been lifted out of poverty and all poverty-stricken counties have been stripped of their hats .
Effective prevention and control of major financial risks ;
Energy consumption per unit of GDP and emissions of major pollutants continued to decline ,
We will strive to accomplish the tasks set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan .
We need to make clear that we have not set a specific target for the annual economic growth rate , mainly because of the global epidemic situation and the great uncertainty in the economic and trade situation .
Doing so will help guide all parties to concentrate on the " six stable " , " six guarantees " .
" Six Guarantees " is the focus of this year 's " Six Stable " work .
Hold the " six guarantees " bottom line , you can stabilize the basic economic market ;
To ensure the promotion of stability , stability and progress , we can build a well-off society in an all-round way to lay a solid foundation .
It should be noted that in order to maintain employment and people 's livelihood , achieve the goal of poverty eradication and prevent and mitigate risks , it is necessary to have the support of economic growth so as to ensure the stability of economic operations .
Reform and opening-up should be adopted to stabilize employment , ensure people 's livelihood and promote consumption , boost the market and stabilize growth , and set out a new path for effectively dealing with shocks and realizing a virtuous circle .
An active fiscal policy should be more active and productive .
This year , the deficit rate will be set at over 3.6 percent.The size of the deficit will increase by 1 trillion yuan over last year , and a special national debt of 1 trillion yuan will be issued to fight the epidemic .
This is a special initiative for a special period .
All the above-mentioned 2 trillion yuan has been transferred to local governments , and a special transfer and payment mechanism has been set up , whereby funds go directly to the municipal and county levels , directly benefiting enterprises and people , and are mainly used to guarantee employment , basic people 's livelihood and market subjects , including support for tax reduction and reduction , rent reduction and interest rate reduction , expansion of consumption and investment .
We need to make vigorous efforts to optimize the structure of financial expenditure so that basic people 's livelihood expenditure will only increase or decrease , expenditure in key areas will be effectively guaranteed , general expenditure will be firmly reduced or reduced , new buildings and halls will be strictly prohibited , and extravagance and waste will be strictly prohibited .
Governments at all levels must truly live a tight life.The central government should take the lead and arrange for negative growth of expenditures at the corresponding levels of the central government , of which the non-rigid expenditure should be reduced by more than 50 percent .
All kinds of balances , precipitation of funds to be collected , rescheduled .
You must vigorously improve quality and efficiency , all expenditure must be carefully calculated , be sure to use every sum of money in the blade , critical place , be sure to let the main body of the market and the people have a real sense .
A prudent monetary policy should be more flexible and appropriate .
The broad money supply and the scale of social financing were guided by a combination of interest rate cuts and reloans , which were significantly higher than last year .
We will keep the exchange rate of the Renminbi basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level .
Innovative monetary policy instruments that go directly to the real economy must promote easy access to credit by enterprises and a sustained downward trend in interest rates .
Priority policies on employment should be strengthened in an all-round way .
Fiscal , monetary , and investment policies need to be cohesive to support stable employment .
Efforts will be made to stabilize existing employment , actively increase new employment and promote the re-employment of the unemployed .
All localities should clean up and remove unreasonable restrictions on employment , to promote employment measures to do their best , job expansion methods to be able to be exhausted .
Poverty eradication is a hard task to be accomplished in order to build a well-off society in an all-round way .
We must adhere to the current poverty eradication standards , increase input into poverty eradication , intensify the implementation of poverty eradication measures and ensure that all remaining poor people are lifted out of poverty ,
We will improve and implement the mechanism for monitoring and assisting the poverty-stricken population so as to consolidate the achievements made in poverty eradication .
We must fight the battles of blue sky , clear water and clear soil to achieve the staging objectives of the battle of pollution prevention and control .
We will strengthen the prevention and control of major risks in areas such as finance and firmly adhere to the bottom line that systemic risks do not occur .
Nearly five months have passed this year ,
The next stage should not relax the prevention and control of the epidemic situation on a regular basis and do a good job in all aspects of economic and social development .
The policies put in place are strong and sustainable and can be improved in the light of changing circumstances .
We are determined and capable of accomplishing our objectives throughout the year .
Increase the implementation of macro policies and focus on stabilizing the employment of enterprises
In order to ensure employment and people 's livelihood , it is necessary to stabilize hundreds of millions of market participants and do our utmost to help enterprises , especially small , medium and medium-sized enterprises and individual businesses , to tide over difficulties .
We will step up tax reduction and fee reduction .
We will strengthen our phased policies and combine them with institutional arrangements to release water and fish to help market players relieve poverty and promote development .

Comrades !
At the beginning of reform and opening to the outside world , our Party issued a great call to follow its own path and build socialism with Chinese characteristics .
Since then , our Party has united with and led the people of all ethnic groups in their unremitting struggle to bring China 's economic strength , scientific and technological strength , national defense strength and overall national strength into the forefront of the world .
To promote the unprecedented upgrading of China 's international status ,
The face of the Party , the face of the country , the face of the people , the face of the army and the face of the Chinese nation have undergone unprecedented changes .
After a long period of hard work , socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era , which is the new historical orientation of China 's development .
The entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into the new era means that the long-suffering Chinese nation since modern times has ushered in a great leap from standing up , getting rich to becoming strong , ushered in a bright prospect of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation ;
It means that scientific socialism has shown great vitality and vigor in China in the 21st century and raised the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics at a high level in the world .
It means that the road , theory , system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics are developing continuously , thus expanding the ways for developing countries to move towards modernization .
It has provided new choices for countries and ethnic groups in the world who wish to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence , and has contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to the solution of human problems .
This new era is an era in which the great victories of socialism with Chinese characteristics are won by carrying forward the past and starting from the present , carrying forward the past and continuing to win under new historical conditions .
Is a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way , and then the construction of a strong socialist modernization era ,
It is an era in which the people of all ethnic groups work together to create a better life and gradually realize the common prosperity of all the people .
It is an era when all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation will act with one heart and strive to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation . It is an era when China is getting closer to the center of the world stage and making greater contributions to mankind .
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era , and the principal contradiction in our society has been transformed into a contradiction between the people 's ever-increasing need for a better life and their uneven and inadequate development .
China has solved the problem of food and clothing for more than one billion people in a stable way , and has generally achieved a well-off society , which will soon be a well-off society in all respects .
The need for a better life for the people is becoming more and more widespread ,
Not only do they place higher demands on material and cultural life , but they are also increasingly demanding democracy , the rule of law , equity , justice , security and the environment .
At the same time , the level of social productive forces in China has on the whole improved markedly , and the social productive capacity has entered the forefront of the world in many respects .
Even more striking is the inadequacy of development imbalances , which have become a major constraint in meeting the growing needs of people for a better life .
It must be recognized that the change of the principal contradiction in our society is a historic change that has a bearing on the overall situation and put forward many new demands on the work of the Party and the state .
We should , on the basis of continued promotion of development , work hard to address the imbalance and inadequacy of development and improve the quality and efficiency of development .
We will better meet the growing economic , political , cultural , social and ecological needs of the people and promote their all-round development and social progress .
We must realize that the changes in the principal contradictions of our society have not changed our judgment of the historical stage of socialism in our country .
China 's basic national conditions , which are still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come , remain unchanged , and China 's international status as the world 's largest developing country remains unchanged .
The whole Party must firmly grasp the basic national conditions of the primary stage of socialism and firmly base itself on the biggest reality of the primary stage of socialism .
Firmly adhering to the Party 's basic line , the lifeline of the Party and the state and the line of happiness of the people ,
To lead and unite the people of all ethnic groups , with economic development as the central focus ,
Adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles , persist in reform and opening to the outside world , work hard and self-reliantly to build China into a strong , prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced , harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country .
COMRADES ,
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era in the history of the People 's Republic of China .
It is of great significance in the history of the development of the Chinese nation , in the history of world socialism and in the history of human society .
The whole Party should strengthen confidence and work hard to make socialism with Chinese characteristics display stronger vitality .
Second , the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new era
A hundred years ago , the October Revolution sent Marxism-Leninism to China with a cannon .
From the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism , the advanced elements in China have seen the way out to solve China 's problems .
In the fierce movement of Chinese society since modern times , in the fierce struggle of the Chinese people against feudal rule and foreign aggression , and in the course of the integration of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese workers ' movement , the Communist Party of China came into being in 1921 .
Since then , the Chinese people have taken the lead in their struggle for national independence , liberation , national prosperity and strength , and people 's happiness .
The Chinese nation , with a civilization history of more than 5,000 years , has created a splendid Chinese civilization , made outstanding contributions to mankind and become a great nation in the world .
After the Opium War , China was plunged into a dark state of internal and external sufferings , and the Chinese people experienced heavy suffering caused by frequent wars , broken mountains and rivers and people 's livelihood .
For the sake of national rejuvenation , innumerable benevolent men and women have waged heroic struggles and made all kinds of attempts , but in the end they have failed to change the social character of the old China and the tragic fate of the Chinese people .
Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation since modern times .
The Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , once founded , has made the realization of communism its highest ideal and ultimate goal , and has shouldered the historical mission of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
Unity led the people in their arduous struggle and wrote a magnificent epic poem engulfing mountains and rivers .
Our Party is keenly aware that to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , we must topple the three great mountains of imperialism , feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism that have oppressed the Chinese people and realize national independence , people 's liberation , national unity and social stability .
Our Party united and led the people to find a correct revolutionary path to surround the city with the countryside and seize power by force .
China fought bloody battles for 28 years , completed the New Democratic Revolution , and established the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , accomplishing China 's great leap from feudal autocracy of several thousand years to people 's democracy .
Our Party is keenly aware that in order to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , an advanced social system must be established that conforms to our reality .
Our Party unites and leads the people in accomplishing the socialist revolution , establishing the basic system of socialism and advancing socialist construction ,
Having accomplished the most extensive and profound social transformation in the history of the Chinese nation ,
It has laid the fundamental political premise and institutional foundation for all development and progress in contemporary China .
Realized the Chinese nation from the modern times continue to decline to fundamentally reverse the fate of continued prosperity and strength of the great leap .
Our Party is deeply aware that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation must conform to the trend of the times , the will of the people and the courage to reform and open up .
Let the cause of the Party and the people always be imbued with a strong impetus to forge ahead .
Our Party united with and led the people in the great new revolution of reform and opening up , cleared up all ideological and institutional obstacles to the development of the country and the nation , and blazed up the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics ,
Let China make great strides to catch up with the times .
In the past 96 years , in order to realize the historical mission of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , whether small or strong , whether in prosperity or adversity , our Party has been steadfast and unswerving .
Unity has led the people through many difficulties , made great sacrifices , dared to face twists and turns , the courage to correct mistakes , overcome one after another seemingly insurmountable difficulties , and created one after another a huge historical miracle in the world .
Comrades !
Today , more than at any time in history , we are closer , more confident and capable of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
Half a mile makes half a mile .
The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can never be achieved with ease and by beating the drums .
The whole Party must be prepared to make even harder and harder efforts .
There must be a great struggle to achieve great dreams .
Society is advancing in contradictory movements ,
Contradictions lead to struggles .
To unite and lead the people to effectively meet major challenges , resist major risks , overcome major obstacles and resolve major contradictions , our Party must wrestle with great struggles with many new historical characteristics .
We will expand channels for farmers to increase their employment and incomes .
It supports farmers to find jobs near them and start businesses , promotes the integrated development of one , two or three industries , expands the scale of providing work as a form of relief , and enables returned migrant workers to work and earn income .
We will strengthen farmers ' vocational skill training .
To eradicate , in accordance with the law , the problem of arrears in payment of wages to migrant workers .
We will support the main body of operation at an appropriate scale and strengthen the socialized service for farmers .
We will support further processing of agricultural products .
We will improve the policy on land use protection for rural industrial development .
Strengthening the collective economic strength .
We will increase the input of special bonds to support modern agricultural facilities , drinking-water safety projects and improvement of the living environment so as to continuously improve farmers ' production and living conditions .
Any thought or action that is greedy of enjoyment , passive laziness , and avoidance of contradictions is wrong .
The whole Party must more consciously adhere to the Party 's leadership and the socialist system of our country , and resolutely oppose all words and deeds that weaken , distort or negate the Party 's leadership and the socialist system of our country ;
More consciously safeguard the interests of the people , and resolutely oppose all acts that harm the interests of the people , divorced from the masses ;
More consciously devote to the trend of reform and innovation era , and resolutely break down all the persistent diseases ;
More consciously safeguard China 's sovereignty , security and development interests , and resolutely oppose any act that separates the motherland , undermines national unity and social harmony and stability ;
We will more consciously guard against all risks and resolutely overcome all difficulties and challenges in the political , economic , cultural , social and other fields as well as in the natural world .
The whole Party must fully realize the long-term , complex and arduous nature of this great struggle , carry forward the spirit of struggle , improve its competence in it and win new victories in it .
Great projects must be built to realize great dreams .
This great project is the new great project of Party building , which our Party is deeply advancing .
History has proved , and will continue to prove , that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China , national rejuvenation is bound to be utopian .
Our Party must always be the vanguard of the times , the backbone of the nation and the ruling party of Marxism .
The whole Party should strengthen the principle of party nature more conscientiously .
Brave to face up to the problem , dare to shave the bone to heal , eliminate all the factors that damage the Party 's advanced and pure nature , remove all the virus that erodes the Party 's healthy body ,
We will continue to strengthen the Party 's political leadership , ideological guidance , mass organization and social appeal so as to ensure that the Party maintains its strong vitality and combat effectiveness .
Great things must be done to make great dreams come true .
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has been the subject of all the Party 's theories and practices since the reform and opening up .
It is a fundamental achievement of the Party and the people , achieved through arduous efforts and at great cost .
The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only way to realize socialist modernization and create a better life for the people .
The theory system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the correct theory to guide the Party and the people to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
The socialist system with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental institutional guarantee for the development and progress of contemporary China , and socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is a powerful spiritual force that inspires the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups in China to work hard and march forward .
The whole Party should enhance road confidence , theoretical confidence , institutional confidence and cultural confidence more consciously .
Neither the old closed and rigid road , nor the evil way of changing one 's own flag ,
We will maintain political stability , do our best to rejuvenate the country and stay committed to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics .
Great struggles , great projects , great causes , great dreams , close ties , connections , interactions ,
It is the great new project of Party building that plays a decisive role .
The great project should be carried out in conjunction with the practice of great struggles , great undertakings and great dreams .
To ensure that the Party remains at the forefront of the times in the historical process of profound changes in the world situation ,
It has always been the backbone of the Chinese people in the historical process of coping with various risks and tests at home and abroad .

The Ideology and Basic Strategy of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era
Since the Eighteenth National Congress , changes in domestic and foreign situations and the development of various undertakings in China have brought us a major issue of the times .
This is to systematically answer , from the combination of theory and practice , what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics and how to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era ,
Including the basic questions of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era , such as the general objective , overall task , overall layout , strategic layout and direction of development , mode of development , motive force for development , strategic steps , external conditions and political guarantee ,
In addition , according to the new practice , theoretical analysis and policy guidance should be made in the fields of economy , politics , the rule of law , science and technology , culture , education , people 's livelihood , nationality , religion , society , ecological civilization , national security , national defense and the armed forces , " one country , two systems " and the reunification of the motherland , the united front , foreign affairs and Party building , so as to help us better adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics .
Turning to this major issue of the times , our Party adheres to taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , the important thought of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development as its guidance .
Upholding emancipation of mind , seeking truth from facts , advancing with the times , and seeking truth and pragmatism ,
Adhering to dialectical materialism and historical materialism , closely integrating the new conditions of the times and practical requirements , and deepening our understanding of the laws on governance by the Communist Party , on building socialism and on the development of human society with a completely new perspective ,
We have made arduous theoretical explorations , made great achievements in theoretical innovation and formed the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era .
Thought of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era ,

To make clear that the main contradiction in our society in the new era is between the people 's ever-increasing need for a better life and their uneven and inadequate development . We must adhere to the people-centered concept of development and constantly promote the all-round development of people and the common prosperity of the whole people ;
We should make clear that the overall layout of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics is " five in one " and the strategic layout is " four in all " , and emphasize firm road , theoretical , institutional and cultural confidence ;
It is clear that the overall goal of deepening reform in an all-round way is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promote the modernization of the state governance system and capacity .
It is clear that the general goal of promoting the rule of law is to build a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and build a socialist country under the rule of law .
It is clear that the Party 's goal for a strong army in the new era is to build a people 's army under the Party 's command , capable of winning battles and with a fine style of work , and to build the people 's army into a world-class army ;
It is clear that major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics should promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind .
The most important advantage of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is that it is under the leadership of the Communist Party of China , and the Party is the highest political leading force .
The thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is an inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , the important thought of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development .
It is the latest achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism , the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people .
It is an important part of the system of theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics and a guide for action by the whole Party and people throughout the country in their struggle for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
